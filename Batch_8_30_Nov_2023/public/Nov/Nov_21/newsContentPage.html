                There was little progress in efforts to reach 41 workers trapped inside a collapsed tunnel in Uttarkashi as the operation entered its second week with rescuers on Sunday adopting a five-pronged approach to evacuate the people. The rescuers were also carving out a track on the mountaintop to reach the top of the tunnel from where they can drill a vertical hole to pull the workers out.
