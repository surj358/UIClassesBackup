        <h2>TODAY'S NEWS</h2>
        <h3>Policis</h3>
        <p class="first">Opposition parties will continue their aggressive protests in both Houses of Parliament and press for a statement from 
            Home Minister Amit Shah on the Parliament security breach issue, sources said on Friday. 
            According to the sources, during their floor coordination meeting this morning, leaders of the INDIA parties 
            decided to continue their aggressive stance in Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha.</p>
        <h3>Cinema</h3>
        <p class="second">On Friday evening, The Victorian State Government of Australia, and the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) brought together popular faces from the world of Hindi cinema. The idea was to celebrate the legacy of Indian films. From Malaika Arora, Shabana Azmi to several other popular actors and filmmakers were a part of the soirée.
            Margaret Gardner AC, the Governor of Victoria who was present at the event, spoke to us about the changing dynamics between the Indian and Australian community.</p>
        <h3>Sorts</h3>
        <p class="third">Both Jemimah Rodrigues and Shubha Satheesh got their Test caps on Thursday morning at the DY Patil Stadium, but their 
            journey in the game till here couldn’t have been in starker contrast.

            Jemimah, a prodigy from her days in Mumbai age-group cricket, had already played 113 times for India at the senior level 
            in white-ball cricket. Shubha, a left-field selection to India’s Test squad after impressing in an intra-squad 
            red-ball game last month in Bengaluru, is a relative unknown who was playing her first-ever senior international.</p>
