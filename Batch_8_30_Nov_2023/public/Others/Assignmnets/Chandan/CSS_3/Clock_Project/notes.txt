clock - from 12 to 12 its deg is 360
so in 12 hr its angle will be 360 deg 
so in 1 hr = 360/12
for h hrs = 30h + m/2 deg 

1 hr = 60 min
60 min = 30deg
in 1 min = 30/60 = 1/2
m mins = (1/2)m


for 60 min = 360 deg
1 min = 360/60 = 6deg
 m min = 6m

 60 sec = 360 deg 
 1 sec = 360/60 = 6 deg
 s secs = 6s.
