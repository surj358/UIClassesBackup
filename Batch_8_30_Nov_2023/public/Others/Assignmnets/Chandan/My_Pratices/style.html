                U.S. thwarts plot to kill Sikh separatist in America, issues warning to India: report
                The protest to New Delhi was registered after PM Modi was welcomed on a state visit by President Joe Biden in June, the report said
                The report comes two months after Canada said there were "credible" allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of a Khalistani
                 leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in a Vancouver suburb. India has rejected Canada's accusations, calling the charges “motivated” and “absurd”.

                India suspended all visa facilities for Canadian citizens following a controversy triggered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s remarks that 
                Indian agents were responsible for the June 18 killing of Khalistan Tiger Force chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
                India had stopped visa services at all Indian missions in Canada citing danger to the lives of Indian officials who were being targeted by
                Canadian nationals who had put out notices echoing Mr. Trudeau’s remarks. That had gradually turned into a blanket ban on visa services
                 for all Canadian citizens across the world. As a result no Canadian citizens could apply for Indian visa even through Indian missions
                 in third countries.

                Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has sought to counter the Congress’s allegation that Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and
                Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) workers had unleashed wanton violence against Opposition activists who staged a “peaceful” black
                 flag demonstration at the motorcade ferrying the Cabinet from a Navakerala Sadas venue in Kannur on November 20 (Monday).
                 Speaking to journalists in Kannur on November 21, Mr. Vijayan said that the DYFI workers had prevented the Congress worker who tried to 
                 throw himself in front of the moving bus transporting the Cabinet.
