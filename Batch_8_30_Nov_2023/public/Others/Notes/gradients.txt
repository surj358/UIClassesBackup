Gradients:
    Linear Gradients (can apply for direction down/up/left/right/diagonally)   
        background-image: linear-gradient(pink, yellow);
        background-image: linear-gradient(direction, red, yellow);
        background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color1, color2);
        Repeating a linear-gradient :
            The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients:
                background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(#ccc, green 10%, yellow 20%);

                
    Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
        A radial gradient is allways defined by its center.
            background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green);
            background-image: radial-gradient(red 5%, yellow 15%, green 60%);
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);
            background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(pink, #ccc 10%, green 15%);

    Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
        A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
            background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
            background-image: conic-gradient(red 55deg, yellow 60deg, green 210deg);
        Repeating
            background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
