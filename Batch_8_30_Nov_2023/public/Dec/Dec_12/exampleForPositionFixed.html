        Synopsis
Panera Bread faces a second lawsuit over its high-caffeine "Charged Lemonade" allegedly linked to a Florida man's fatal cardiac arrest. Dennis Brown, 46, reportedly consumed the drink for days, a member of Panera’s drink club. With 390mg caffeine per large serving, near FDA limits, Panera defends its product's safety despite prior legal action over a student's similar death. Lawsuits claim inadequate warnings, sparking concern over disclosure and consumer safety.
